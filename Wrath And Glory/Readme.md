# WH40k Wrath & Glory Die Roller
This is a die roller for use on Roll20.net with the Warhammer 40k Wrath & Glory RPG. 

### Current Version

### Many Thanks	
More thanks than I can give go to The Aaron whose MYZ Die Roller was the foundation for this script roller; the first use of this script was for Forbidden Lands -- where his patience enabled me to adapt this script -- and became the basis of the same die roller for Wrath & Glory.

### TODO

Update on full release of the rules in August.
